title: Retrieve one Story
---

Returns a story object for the `full_slug`, `id` or `uuid` if authenticated using a preview or public token.

| Path Parameter           | Description          |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| `:full_slug`          | Use the `full_slug` of your content entry to retrieve it. |
| `:id`          | Use the numeric `id` of your content entry to retrieve it |
| `:uuid`               | You can use the `uuid` property to query for your content entry. To tell our API to use the `uuid` instead of the `id` append the query param `find_by=uuid` | 

| Query Parameter           | Description          |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| `token` (required) | Your public or preview token |
| `find_by` | Added if you want to query by `uuid` instead of using the numeric `id` | 
| `version` | Default: `published`. Possible values: `draft`, `published` |
| `resolve_links` | The parameter `resolve_links` will automatically resolve internal links of the multilink field type. Resolved links can be found in root of response under the property `links`. If the value is story the whole story object will be included. If the value is `url` only uuid, id, name, path, slug and url (url is a computed property which returns the "Real path" if defined to use it for navigation links) will be included. if the value is link it will return id, uuid, slug, path, parent_id, name, position etc. The limit of resolved links per Story is 50 when resolving with story and 100 when resolving with url. |
| `resolve_relations` | Resolve relationships to other Stories of a multi-option or single-option field-type. Provide the component name and the field key as comma separated string. Resolved relations can be found in root of response under the property `rels`. The limit of resolved relationships is `100` Stories. You can't use this filter to resolve relations of resolved entries (eg. nested relationship resolving). Example: `resolve_relations=page.author,page.categories`; Read more about it in our [tutorial](https://www.storyblok.com/tp/using-relationship-resolving-to-include-other-content-entries). |
| `from_release` | Access version of specific release by release id |
| `cv` | Read more about cache version at [Cache invalidation](#topics/cache-invalidation) |
| `language` | Add the language i18n code as query parameter to receive a localized version |
| `fallback_lang` | Define a custom fallback language (i18n code). By default the fallback language is the one defined in the space settings  |

**Response**

The response will contain following attributes:

| Property         | Description          |
|------------------|----------------------|

| `cv`             | The [cache version](#topics/cache-invalidation) |
| `rels`           | Array of related [story objects](#the-story-object) when using the resolve_relations parameter |
| `links`          | Array of link or [story objects](#the-story-object) when using the resolve_links parameter |
| `rel_uuids`      | Array of the uuids of all the related [story objects](#the-story-object) if the `resolve_relations` parameter is in use and if the limit of resolvable relations is hit |
| `link_uuids`     | Array of the uuids of all the links if the `resolve_links` parameter is in use and if the limit of resolvable links is hit |
